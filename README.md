# PromptBasedTesting

Welcome to my repository, where I share my personal experience with prompting using ChatGPT throughout my learning and testing journey. This project is the culmination of my journey through various prompting courses, exploring the depths of artificial intelligence, and its application in real-world development and testing tasks.

Here, you will find a collection of prompts and examples of using ChatGPT that I have compiled and tested during my studies. These materials are intended to provide valuable lessons and insights for those looking to integrate AI into their testing and development processes.

My goal is to create a resource that not only showcases my development and learning but also serves as inspiration and a practical guide for other developers interested in applying prompting in their work.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful for yourself!
