## Use Case #1: Creating Scenarios for Load Testing Login Functionality

### Context

In performance testing, simulating accurate user behavior and load is essential for identifying potential bottlenecks and ensuring an application's scalability and reliability. This use case is centered on generating detailed scenarios for load testing a web application's login feature to cover a broad range of conditions, from normal operations to peak load situations.

### Prompt

"Generate user login flow scenarios to simulate varying loads on a web application's login functionality."

### Response

1. **Normal Load Scenario**
   - **Objective:** To simulate the average number of users attempting to log in under normal conditions.
   - **User Volume:** 100-500 users logging in per hour.
   - **User Behavior:** Users enter correct login credentials on the first or second attempt.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The system processes all login requests smoothly without significant delays.
2. **Peak Load Scenario**
   - **Objective:** To test the system's performance during peak usage times, such as during a sale or a product launch.
   - **User Volume:** 2,000-5,000 users attempting to log in per hour.
   - **User Behavior:** High volume of legitimate traffic with users making multiple login attempts, some due to forgotten passwords.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The system may experience slower response times but should not crash and should still handle requests within acceptable time limits.

### Conclusion

Using ChatGPT to come up with test scenarios helps us get ready better for different amounts of users logging in. It's like making a plan to test our website in ways that mimic real-life situations. This way, we can find and fix any issues before they affect users
